**ðŸ‘‹Hi, I'm Dinesh Sai Rallapalli!**

**ðŸ”§ Robotics Engineer | Controls Enthusiast | Embedded Systems Developer**

Currently pursuing my Master's in Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering at NYU, I'm passionate about building intelligent robotic systems that blend motion control, real-time optimization, and advanced sensor integration.

**ðŸš€ Areas of Expertise:**

**â€¢ Control Systems & Robotics:** Trajectory generation, motion control, state estimation, bipedal locomotion, PID control, Kalman filters.

**â€¢ Embedded Systems:** Hands-on experience with NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi, microcontrollers, and sensor integration in robotics projects.

**â€¢ Programming:** Proficient in C, C++, Python, and MATLAB for developing scalable, reliable algorithms.

**â€¢ Real-Time Robotics Projects:** From bipedal trajectory optimization to real-time localization using sensor fusion, I focus on taking robotic prototypes from concept to real-world implementation.

**ðŸ’¡ Selected Projects:**

**â€¢ Bipedal Robot Trajectory Optimization:** Developing energy-efficient motion plans and stability algorithms for improved balance control.

**â€¢ Sensor Fusion for Localization:** Integrated IMU data with Kalman filters to achieve 90% localization accuracy in challenging environments.

**â€¢ Multi-Modal Robotic Systems:** Built and implemented control for a hybrid ground-and-air robot with real-time PID control for mode transitions.

Feel free to explore my GitHub to see some of my projects that blend cutting-edge robotics, controls, and embedded technology. Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate on exciting projects that push the boundaries of autonomous systems and humanoid robotics.

**ðŸŒ± Currently Learning:** Advanced machine learning for robotics and reinforcement learning for real-time control.
